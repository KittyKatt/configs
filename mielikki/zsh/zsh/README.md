# ZSH

These files comprise my entire zsh setup. To use, please follow these
instructions.

* Install `zprezto` on your system by doing `git clone --recursive https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto.git "${ZDOTDIR:-$HOME}/.zprezto"`
* The `powerline10k` theme is already installed, you just have to modify `${HOME}/.zpreztorc` to enable it. It's already enabled in the local zpreztorc here.

Below is a screenshot of just a little bit of the setup in action.
