# ZSH

These files comprise my entire zsh setup. To use, please follow these 
instructions.

* zshrc is `~/.zshrc`
* zsh folder is `~/.config/zsh`
* the `zsh-syntax-highlighting` folder is a submodule.  You will have to clone 
this separately. You can do this by navigating inside the cloned folder and 
executing `git submodule update --init --recursive`.

Below is a screenshot of just a little bit of the setup in action.
